<!--
	AngularJS has directives for binding application data to the attributes of HTML DOM elements.
	DOM Recap:
	When a webpage is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The HTML DOM model can be viewed as a tree of Objects.
	With the object model, JavaScript (and AngularJS) can carry out commands to make the HTML webpage more dynamic including:
	- Changing HTML elements in a page
	- Changing HTML attributes in a page
	- Changing CSS styles in a page
	- Removing existing HTML elements and attributes
	- Adding new HTML elements and attributes
	- Reacting to existing HTML events in a page
	- Creating new HTML events in a page

	The ng-show directive shows or hides an HTML element.
	This is based on the value of the ng-show.

	The ng-hide directive does the same but in opposite order to the ng-show directive.
