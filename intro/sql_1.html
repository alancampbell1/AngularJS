<!--
	AngularJS is perfect for displaying data from a Database. It is important that the data is in JSON format.

	Cross Site HTTP Requests:
	Requests for data from a different server is called a cross-site HTTP request.
	Cross-site requests are common on the web. Many pages load CSS, images and scripts from different servers.
	In modern browsers, cross-site HTTP requests from scripts are restricted to same site for security reasons.
