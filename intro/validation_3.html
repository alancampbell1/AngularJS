<!--
	AngularJS can validate input data. This is client-side form validation and AngularJS monitors the state of the form and input fields (input, textare, select) and lets you notify the user about the current state.
	You can use standard HTML5 attributes to validate input or make your own validation functions.

	AngularJS adds CSS classes to forms and input fields depending on their states. The following classes are added to and removed from input fields:
	ng-untouched - the field has not been touched yet
	ng-touched - the field has been touched
	ng-pristine - the field has not been modified yet
	ng-dirty - the field has been modified
	ng-valid - the field content is valid
	ng-invalid - the field content is not valid
	ng-valid-key - one key for each validation
	ng-invalid-key

	The following classes are added to, removed from, forms:
	ng-pristine, ng-dirty, ng-valid, ng-invalid, ng-valid-key, ng-invalid-key
	The classes are removed if the value they represent is false. 

	The following is an example of changing CSS style when the user enters information.
