<!--
	AngularJS has directives for binding application data to the attributes of HTML DOM elements.
	DOM Recap:
	When a webpage is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The HTML DOM model can be viewed as a tree of Objects.
	With the object model, JavaScript (and AngularJS) can carry out commands to make the HTML webpage more dynamic including:
	- Changing HTML elements in a page
	- Changing HTML attributes in a page
	- Changing CSS styles in a page
	- Removing existing HTML elements and attributes
	- Adding new HTML elements and attributes
	- Reacting to existing HTML events in a page
	- Creating new HTML events in a page

	The 'ng-disabled' directive binds AngularJS application data to the disabled attribute of HTML elements.

	App explained:
	- The ng-disabled directive binds the application data 'mySwitch' to the HTML button's disabled attribute
	- The ng-model directive binds the value of the HTML checkbox element to the value of mySwitch, either true or false
	- If the value of mySwitch is true, the button comes disabled and unable to work
