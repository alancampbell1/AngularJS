<!--
	The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data
	The ng-model directive can provide status for application data, e.g. invalid, dirty, touched, error.

	If true is returned from $valid then the email meets all the criteria.
	If true is returned from $dirty then the value has been changed.
	If true is returned from $touched then the field has been in focus.
