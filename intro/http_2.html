<!--
	$http is an AngularJS service for reading data from remote servers. It makes a request to a server and returns the response.

	The following example uses the get() method of the $http service. get() is an example of a short cut method. Several others include:
	- .delete()
	- .head()
	- .jsonp()
	- .post()
	- .put()

	The data you get from the response is expected to be in JSON format. JSON is an excellent way of transporting data and easy to use with AngularJS.

	The following example GET's JSON data from an online source, wraps it on an array called 'records' and uses 'ng-repeat' to print it to the screen.

	Breakdown of what is happening:
	- The application defines a myCtrl controller, with a $scope and $http object
	- $http is an XMLHttpRequest object used to request external data
	- $http.get() reads JSON data from the link provided
	- If successful, 'myData' stores the information from the server and x.id requests specific 'id' data and name requests specific 'name' data.
	- ng-repeat means this is repeated for each JSON entry
