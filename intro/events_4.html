<!--
	AngularJS has its own HTML events directives.
	You can add AngularJS event listeners to your HTML elements by using one or more of these directives examples: ng-blur, ng-change, ng-click, ng-copy, ng-cut, ng-dblclick, ng-focus, ng-keydown etc.

	Event directives allows us to run AngularJS functions at certain user events.
	AngularJS events will not overwrite a HTML event. Both will be executed.
	
	You can pass the $event object as an argument when calling a function. The $event object contains the browser's event object.
