<!--
	AngularJS can validate input data. This is client-side form validation and AngularJS monitors the state of the form and input fields (input, textare, select) and lets you notify the user about the current state.
	You can use standard HTML5 attributes to validate input or make your own validation functions.

	AngularJS is constantly updating the state of both the form and input fields.
	Input fields have the following states:
	$untouched - the field has not been touched yet
	$touched - the field has been touched
	$pristine - the field has not been modified yet
	$dirty - the field has been modified
	$invalid - the field content is not valid
	$valid - the field content is valid
	They are all properties of the input field and are either 'true' or 'false'.

	Forms have the following states:
	$pristine - No fields have been modified yet
	$dirty - one or more have been modified
	$invalid - the form content is valid
	$submitted - the form is submitted
	All these states of the form are either 'true' or 'false'

	You can use states to show meaningful messages to the user.
	
	In the following example, an error message is shown if a field has been touched and is still empty
