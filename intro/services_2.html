<!--
	A service, in AngularJS, is a function or an object that is available for and limited to your AngularJS application.

	AngularJS allows you to use one of their 30 in-built services or create one your self.

	The $http service is one of the most commonly used services. The service makes a request to a server and lets your application handle the response.
