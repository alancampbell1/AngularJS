<!--
	The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
	The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.
	It is also available for both the view and controller.

	In the context of MVC (Model View Controller) an AngularJS application can be split into the following:
	View - which is the HTML
	Model - This is the data available for the current view
	Controller - which is a JS function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.

	The scope in this instance is the Model. Remember, the scope is a JS object available to both the view and controller.
