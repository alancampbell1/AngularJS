<!--
	Data Binding is a technique to bind data sources from the provider and consumer together and synchronizes them.
	In AngularJS it is the synchronization between the model and the view.

	AngularJS applications usually have a data model. This is a collection of data available to the application.

	The HTML container is where the AngularJS application is displayed. This is also called the view. The view has access to the model (which is a collection of data) and there are several ways of displaying the model's data in the view.
