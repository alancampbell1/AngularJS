<!--
	AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications. They are known as regular JavaScript Objects.
	A controller can also have methods, i.e. variables as functions.

	In larger applications, it is common to store controllers in external files.

	In the following example, controllers_3_5.js contains the controller.
