<!--
	AngularJS binds data to HTML using Expressions.
	Expressions can be written inside double braces {{ expression }} or
	written inside a directive, e.g. ng-bind = " expression ".

	AngularJS will resolve the expression and return the result where the expression was written.

	AngularJS expressions are like JavaScript Expressions. They contain literals, objects and variables.
