<!--
	The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
	The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.
	It is also available for both the view and controller.

	All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.
	The rootScope is available throughout the entire application.
	If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope.
