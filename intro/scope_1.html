<!--
	The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
	The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.
	It is also available for both the view and controller.

	When you make a controller, you pass the $scope object as an argument. This allows you to add properties to the $scope object in the controller and thus the view (HTML) can get access to their properties.
