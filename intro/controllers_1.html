<!--
	AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications. They are known as regular JavaScript Objects.

	The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.
	A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JS object constructor.

	FULL BREAKDOWN:
	The AngularJS application is defined by ng-app="myApp". This runs inside the <div> element.
	The controller is defined by ng-controller="myCtrl". This is also known as an AngularJS directive.
	'myCtrl' is also a JavaScript function.
	AngularJS invokes the controller with a $scope object. $scope is an application object (owner of application variables and functions).
	The controller creates 2 properties/variables in the scope called 'firstname' and 'lastname'.
	The ng-model directives bind the input fields to the controller properties.
