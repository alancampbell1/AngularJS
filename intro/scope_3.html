<!--
	The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
	The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.
	It is also available for both the view and controller.

	It is important to know which scope you are dealing with, at any time.
	In large applications you need to know your scope as sections in the HTML DOM can only access certain scopes.
