<!--
	Data Binding is a technique to bind data sources from the provider and consumer together and synchronizes them.
	In AngularJS it is the synchronization between the model and the view.

	The ng-model directive can be used to bind data from the model to the view on HTML controls, such as input, select, textarea options.

	The ng-model directive provides a two-way binding between the model and the view.
