<!--
	AngularJS has its own HTML events directives.
	You can add AngularJS event listeners to your HTML elements by using one or more of these directives examples: ng-blur, ng-change, ng-click, ng-copy, ng-cut, ng-dblclick, ng-focus, ng-keydown etc.

	Event directives allows us to run AngularJS functions at certain user events.
	AngularJS events will not overwrite a HTML event. Both will be executed.

	This example will focus on Mouse Events. Mouse events occur when the cursor moves over an element (ng-mouseover, ng-mouseenter, ng-mousemove, ng-mouseleave) or when a mouse button is clicked over an element (ng-mousedown, ng-mouseup, ng-click).

	The following example increases a count variable when the mouse moves over the H1 element.
