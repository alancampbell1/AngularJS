<!--
	Data Binding is a technique to bind data sources from the provider and consumer together and synchronizes them.
	In AngularJS it is the synchronization between the model and the view.

	Two-way binding is data binding in AngularJS that is synchronous between the model and the view.
	When the model changes so does the view and vice versa. This happens immediately and automatically.
