<!--
	AngularJS has its own HTML events directives.
	You can add AngularJS event listeners to your HTML elements by using one or more of these directives examples: ng-blur, ng-change, ng-click, ng-copy, ng-cut, ng-dblclick, ng-focus, ng-keydown etc.

	Event directives allows us to run AngularJS functions at certain user events.
	AngularJS events will not overwrite a HTML event. Both will be executed.

	You can use an event directive to toggle true and false. This example demonstrates how to hide and show a piece of HTML code, like a dropdown, when a button acts as a toggle between true and false.

	Each time the myFunc() function is called on the button click, the value of showMe is reversed from true to false and false to true.
