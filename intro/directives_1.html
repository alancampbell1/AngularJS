<!--
	AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.
	AngularJS has a set of built-in directives but also lets you define 
	your own.

	AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes using the prefix ng-

	ng-app directive initialises an AngularJS application
	ng-init directive initialises application data
	ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, text) 
	to app. data.

	The following is an example of how to create your own Directive.
	This is done using the .directive function.
	To invoke a directive, make a HTML element with the same tag name as the
	new directive.
