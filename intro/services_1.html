<!--
	A service, in AngularJS, is a function or an object that is available for and limited to your AngularJS application.

	AngularJS allows you to use one of their 30 in-built services or create one your self.

	This example demonstrates the $location service that has methods to return information about the location of the current web page.

	The main reason to use services, like $location, over objects already in the DOM, such as window.location, services work better when you want your webpage to be dynamic, hence the point of AngularJS.
