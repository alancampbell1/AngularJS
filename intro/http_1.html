<!--
	$http is an AngularJS service for reading data from remote servers. It makes a request to a server and returns the response.

	The following example uses the get() method of the $http service. get() is an example of a short cut method. Several others include:
	- .delete()
	- .head()
	- .jsonp()
	- .post()
	- .put()

	By using the get() method the response is an object with several properties including:
	- .config - the object used to generate the request
	- .data - a string, or object, carrying the response
	- .headers - a function to get header information
	- .status - a number defining the HTTP status
	- .statusText - a string defining the HTTP status
