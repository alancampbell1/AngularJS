<!--
	A service, in AngularJS, is a function or an object that is available for and limited to your AngularJS application.

	AngularJS allows you to use one of their 30 in-built services or create one your self.

	This example builds on the previous one and shows how a service is used inside a filter. To do so we add it as a dependency when defining the filter.
